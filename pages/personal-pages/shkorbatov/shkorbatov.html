<p align="justify">Graduated from Kharkov State University in 1971.<br>
PhD Phys &amp; Math, ILTPE, 1980.<br>
DSc Phys &amp; Math ILTPE,1994.</p>
<p align="justify">Started work at ILTPE in 1971. Research activities: theory of
self-organization, nonequilibrium effects in point contacts, atomic dynamics of
nanostructures. Is the author of about one hundred scientific publications
including two books. Has been a Professor of Kharkov Technical University of
Radioelectronics since 2000 and a visiting professor at the P.J. Safarik
University (Kosice, Slovak Republic) since 1989. Member of the Ukrainian
Physical Society (1993-) and of the International Thermoelectrical Society
(1994-). Provides scientific researches within the framework of agreement on
scientific collaboration between ILTPE and P.J. Safarik University, Kosice,
Slovak Republic.</p>
<p align="justify"><b>Modeling of Discrete Dynamical Systems with Self-Organization</b></p>
<p align="justify">A general mathematical model of an evolution for discrete nonlinear
self-organizing dynamic system under the condition of a long-period relaxation was developed. This activity
was connected closely with the progress on the field of synthetic metastable systems (molecular
engines, carbon nanotubes). Both the analytical treatment and numerical modeling
for the characteristics of a self-organization process were given. It was shown
that the effective self-organization with reduction of the model ensemble
entropy is possible only under condition of a long-period integral memory.</p>
<p align="justify"><b>Lattice Dynamics of Nanocontacts and Quantum Phonon Transport</b></p>
<p align="justify">The atomic frequency distribution functions of the nanocrystal placed between
two solids were calculated. The heat flux was calculated with the quantum phonon
transport in point contact and the impurity monolayer separated the crystals
being taken into account. It is shown that the weak impurity-crystal interaction
results in a resonance-type frequency dependence of the phonon energy
transmission coefficient. The analog of Landauer formula for the phonon
conductivity has been derived for the heat flux through the point contact. The
research is carried out within the frames of agreement on scientific
collaboration between ILTPE and the P.J. Safarik University (Kosice, Slovak
Republic).</p>
<p align="justify"><b>Theory of Point Contact Spectroscopy of Metals</b></p>
<p align="justify">It is shown that for an arbitrary electron elastic scattering length the
second derivative of the current with respect to voltage at the point contact is
proportional to the electron-phonon transport function. The result signifies
that the point-contact spectroscopy should be feasible in metals with
arbitrarily small elastic scattering length. The effect of nonequilibrium of the
phonon system on the spectroscopy of electron-phonon interaction was
investigated in collaboration with Dprt.19 (ILTPE).</p>
<p align="justify"><b>Statistical Mechanics of Long Polymer Chains</b></p>
<p align="justify">Path-integral method was adopted to calculate the cross-section of the light
scattering by optically anisotropic polymer chains in solution. The excluded
volume problem, with respect to the viscometric data, was investigated in
collaboration with Dprt.18 (ILTPE).</p>
