            Modeling of Discrete Dynamical Systems with Self-Organization
          </h3>
          <p>
            A general mathematical model of an evolution for discrete nonlinear
            self-organizing dynamic system under the condition of a long-period
            relaxation was developed. This activity was connected closely with
            the progress on the field of synthetic metastable systems (molecular
            engines, carbon nanotubes). Both the analytical treatment and
            numerical modeling for the characteristics of a self-organization
            process were given. It was shown that the effective
            self-organization with reduction of the model ensemble entropy is
            possible only under condition of a long-period integral memory.

          <h3>Lattice Dynamics of Nanocontacts and Quantum Phonon Transport</h3>
          <p>
            The atomic frequency distribution functions of the nanocrystal
            placed between two solids were calculated. The heat flux was
            calculated with the quantum phonon transport in point contact and
            the impurity monolayer separated the crystals being taken into
            account. It is shown that the weak impurity-crystal interaction
            results in a resonance-type frequency dependence of the phonon
            energy transmission coefficient. The analog of Landauer formula for
            the phonon conductivity has been derived for the heat flux through
            the point contact. The research is carried out within the frames of
            agreement on scientific collaboration between ILTPE and the P.J.
            Safarik University (Kosice, Slovak Republic).

          <h3>
            Theory of Point Contact Spectroscopy of Metals
          </h3>
          <p>
            It is shown that for an arbitrary electron elastic scattering length
            the second derivative of the current with respect to voltage at the
            point contact is proportional to the electron-phonon transport
            function. The result signifies that the point-contact spectroscopy
            should be feasible in metals with arbitrarily small elastic
            scattering length. The effect of nonequilibrium of the phonon system
            on the spectroscopy of electron-phonon interaction was investigated
            in collaboration with Dprt.19 (ILTPE).

            Statistical Mechanics of Long Polymer Chains

          <p>
            Path-integral method was adopted to calculate the cross-section of
            the light scattering by optically anisotropic polymer chains in
            solution. The excluded volume problem, with respect to the
            viscometric data, was investigated in collaboration with Dprt.18
            (ILTPE).
