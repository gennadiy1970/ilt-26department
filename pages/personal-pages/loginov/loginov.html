<p><b><font size="4">Alexander Loginov, </font></b></p>
<p>Graduated from Rostov State University (Russia) in 1965.<br>
PhD Phys &amp; Math, ILTPE, 1974.</p>
<p>1965-1973, assistant at the Department of Theoretical and Nuclear Physics of&nbsp;
Rostov State University; started work at ILTPE in 1976 as a junior researcher,
1986-1991, researcher, 1991 <font face="Courier New">–</font>&nbsp; 2009 senior
researcher.</p>
<p><b>Research area:</b> Theoretical investigation of the phase transition and
dynamical properties of the rare-earth magnetics.</p>
<p><b>The main results :</b></p>
<p>1. An explicit form of an invariant tensor representation for Hamiltonian
electrostatically interacting electrons in solids was obtained with irreducible
operators of Hubbard transition (in collaboration with V.A.Popov).</p>
<p>2. The breakdown of Adler principle for processes of certain types in
isotropic antiferromagnets was found within the framework of magnon-magnon and
exiton-magnon interaction theory. (in collaboration with V.A.Popov).</p>
<p>3. The spectrum structure of one-fermion states of the finite non-closed XY-chain
in the whole range of anisotropy parameters and transverse field magnitudes was
investigated. The nature of ordering for a certain class of systems with
non-degenerate ground state and finite volume was explained (in collaboration
with Yu.V.Pereverzev).</p>
<p>4. For the antiferromagnetic Ising model (S=1) with easy-plane anisotropy
under magnetic field a phase diagram in the temperature-field-anisotropy
coordinates was built within mean-field approximation. (in collaboration with
Yu.V.Pereverzev).</p>
<p>5. Mechanisms of the structural phase transition in the rare-earth magnetics
induced by the magnetic field were investigated numerically within the vibronic
model. The transition observed in KEr(MoO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub> corresponds
qualitatively to the model with two lattice vibration active modes which kinds
of interaction with the electronic excitations are different.</p>
