(11.08.1930 - 03.08.2011)</b></font></p>
<p align="justify">Graduated from Kharkov State University, Faculty of Physics
and Mathematics in 1952.<br>
PhD Phys &amp; Math, Kharkov State University, 1959.<br>
DSc Phys &amp; Math , ILTPE, 1965.</p>
<p align="justify">Diploma of Full Professor, Kharkov Polytechnic Institute
(Department of Physics of Metals), 1969.</p>
<p align="justify"><b>Employment History:</b> Research Institute, Balashiha, Moscow reg.,
(1952-1953, engineer). Lebedev's Physics Institute Acad. of Sc., Moscow (1954
-1957, post-graduate student, junior researcher). Institute of Physics and
Technology, Kharkov, Ukraine (1958-1960, junior researcher; 1960-1968, senior
researcher; 1968-1974, head of laboratory). ILTPE, Kharkov Ukraine, (1974-2003,

<p align="justify"><b>Research interests:</b>&nbsp;<br>
 dynamical and kinetic properties of
metals, dielectrics and low-dimensional systems, spin transport phenomena</p>
<p align="justify"><b>Main results:</b></p>
<p align="justify">1. A new method of the derivation of a quantum kinetic
equation based on the Bogolyubov ideas was built for the quantized systems. A
number of nonstandard problems on kinetics were solved with the help of this method: (i) The
description of the system of electrons interacting with each other and with
phonons in a quantized electromagnetic field was given and the theory of the
absorption of infrared radiation in metals was built; (ii) The Landau-Lifshitz
equation with a relaxation term was derived at a microscopic level (together
with V.M. Tsukernik); (iii) The kinetic equation with the finiteness of the
life-time of the colliding phonons being taken into account was obtained and the
Pomeranchuk problem in the thermal conductivity of dielectrics was solved
(together with A.O. Maksimov).</p>
<p align="justify">2. A number of kinetic phenomena have been predicted under
the conditions when the normal collisions between quasi-particles play a key
role: (i) The Poiseuille flow of phonon gas in dielectrics and the hydrodynamic
minimum in the temperature dependence of electric resistance of metals and
two-dimensional conductors (“Gurzhi effect”) was predicted. Both effects
have been found experimentally. One more predicted hydrodynamic effect was also
observed experimentally, namely, the predominance of anharmonic terms of an
arbitrarily high order in the thermal conductivity of ferrites with temperature
decreasing.</p>
<p align="justify">3. A method which made it possible to describe a wide range
of kinetic phenomena in pure metals at low temperatures, from a general point of
view, in terms of non-local diffusion of electrons over the Fermi surface was built. The
obtained results&nbsp; are closely connected with the variety of
experimental studies (in collaboration with A.I. Kopeliovich).</p>
<p align="justify">4. Qualitatively new mechanisms of electron-phonon and
electron-electron relaxation in two-dimensional conducting systems have been
predicted (in collaboration with A.I. Kopeliovich and S.B. Rutkevich).</p>
<p align="justify">A number of the results mentioned above are included into the
well-known textbooks and monographs on solid state physics, e.g. “L.D.Landau
and E.M. Lifshitz, Physical Kinetics, Vol. 10 ” (Pergamon Press, Oxford, 1981);

1988); J.S. Blakemore “Solid State Physics” (Cambridge University Press,
England, 1985), K.P. Gurov “Fundamentals of the Kinetic Theory” (Nauka,
Moscow, 1966) and others.</p>
