<p align="justify"><b>Research interests:</b> theory of electron and spin
transport in three- and two-dimensional conducting systems</p>
<p align="justify"><b>Main results:</b></p>
<p align="justify">1. A theory of kinetic phenomena in two-dimensional
degenerated electron gas in heterostructures was built. It was shown that
electron-electron scattering in such systems acted in a completely different way
as compared to the three-dimensional metals. New kinetic effects were predicted,
viz. (i) one-dimensional diffusion of charge carriers as a mechanism of charge
transport in two-dimensional systems; (ii) the ultra-sensitivity to weak
magnetic field of relaxation mechanisms, related to the two-dimensional
electron-electron scattering at low temperatures, was predicted. Recently, both
these effects and the typical hydrodynamic minimum of the electric resistance of
two-dimensional high-mobility GaAs/AlGaAS channels have been observed
experimentally by the group of Prof. L. W.Molenkamp (W&#252;rzburg, Germany).</p>
<p align="justify">2. A theory of propagation of electron beams in a
two-dimensional degenerated electron gas was built. The theory was used to
propose and develop a scattering spectroscopy method made it possible to find
experimentally the specific two-dimensional features of the electron-electron
scattering predicted by the group members earlier. The nonlinear effect of the
heating of electron beams in a two dimensional electron gas was predicted and
observed experimentally later.</p>
<p align="justify">3. A ‘‘spin-guide’’ source was proposed. This device
makes possible a long-distance transmission of currents with a high degree of
spin polarization. Under certain conditions a spin-guide could generate an
almost ideally spin-polarized current, even when the magnetic material used is
not fully polarized. The detailed theory of the spin-guide structures was
developed and a number of schemes of spin field-effect transistor both with
electrical and magnetic control were proposed and investigated theoretically.
The role of electron-electron collisions in the charge and momentum transport in
hybrid magnetic/nonmagnetic structures was discussed.</p>
<p align="justify">4. A theory of the injection of super narrow beams into solid
state structures through the micro- and nano-constrictions of arbitrary shape
was developed.</p>
<p align="justify">A number of effects which were predicted by the group members
have been found experimentally in the research laboratories in Russia, Europe
and the USA. Now the group is engaged in the following joint projects: (i)
researches in the field of spin transport theory in collaboration with the group
of Prof. Uzi Landman (Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, USA); (ii)
kinetic phenomena in a two-dimensional electron gas in heterostructures in
collaboration with the experimental group of Prof. Laurens Molenkamp (W&#252;rzburg
University, W&#252;rzburg, Germany).</p>

<p align="justify">5. A scheme of a transistor device which may amplifie and
generate an a.c. spin signal has been proposed. This device exploits the spatial
separation of the spin components of the current and the electric gates in a
special hybrid magnetic-nonmagnetic structure. The construction of such a device
should be feasible with current materials and fabrication techniques.</p>
