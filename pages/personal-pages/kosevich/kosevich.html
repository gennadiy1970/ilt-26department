            Scientific activity is devoted to theoretical researches of
            electronic properties of metals, mechanics of real crystals and
            magnetoordered systems, nonlinear dynamics of the condensed media.
            Together with I. M. Lifshits established (1954) connection between
            the oscillation of magnetic characteristics of metals and the form
            of an electronic surface of Fermi (Lifshits-Kosevich formula) and
            in1953 discovered the phenomenon of quantum dimensional effect in
            the conducting films (the invention was registered in 1977).

          <h3>Lattice Dynamics with Point and Extended Defects</h3>
          <p>
            Lattice dynamics of real crystals is one of the major sections of
            solid state physics which has been investigated in many researches
            of the department. These researches are devoted to study
            quasi-particle excitations in ideal crystals and in crystals with
            various types of defects, dislocation theory of plasticity and
            influence of defects on thermodynamic properties of solids.
          </p>
          <p>
            Linear and nonlinear dynamics of anisotropic crystals and media
            containing extended defects (dislocations, layer defects of the
            interface type and external surfaces covered with monoatomic or
            multyatomic layers) were developed. In the case of linear theory the
            features of dispersion relations for waves and vibrations localized
            near the defects of the resonance type were studied, and the density
            of vibrations of the resonance type in the continuous spectra of
            crystal were analyzed. In particular the conditions are found when
            the vibration spectra of surface or localized waves has termination
            points at the border of the continuous spectra.

            An original method of description of the vibration spectrum and
            atomic dynamics of complex crystal lattices was developed
            (V.Peresada). On the basis of this method multilayered crystals like
            HTSC, quasi-low-dimensional structures, and micro – and nanoclusters
            were studied .

            deformation (surface displacements) in the dynamic surface solitons
            was described.
