            Investigation of nonlinear surface waves during last years includes
            studying of nonlinear surface shear waves (It was demonstrated the
            importance of a spatial dispersion of elastic media and criteria of
            stability for NSSW and surface shear solitons were formulated); the
            SSS were studied as a general problem of 2D and 3D solitons in media
            with acoustic spectrum and the special asyptotical procedures for
            them were proposed; the different surface Rayleigh solitons with a
            stationary profile were investigated near perfect surface and
            surface covered with thin film or monolayer. In the last cases the
            nonlinear non-local ID evolution equations were derived and their
            unusual soliton solutions were obtained. Recently some special
            problems for nonlinear elastic surface waves were investigated:
            propagation of envelope SRS, properties of "gap" SRS near the
            corrugated surface, propagation of exotic solitons with combined
            polarization in nonlinear elastic plates with effective nonlinear
            dispersion, derivation of nonlinear evolution equations for
            nonlinear elastic systems with restricted geometry and second-order
            nonlinearity. Some results were obtained for nonlinear elastic waves
            and solitons near the surface in the incommensurate state.

            Nonlinear dynamics of magnets is a traditional field of interest:
            the specific nonlinear excitations - "magnetic solitons" were
            studying and the novel conception of magnetic soliton as a bound
            state of magnons was formulated. In this area some important results
            were obtained: the exact solutions for ID solitons in ferro- and
            anti-feromagnets; exact many-solitons solutions in ID FM; numerical
            solutions for many-dimensional magnetic solitons; 2D skirmions and
            vortices in FM. Later some specific phenomena of nonlinear magnetic
            structure and dynamics was investigated: magnetic solitons in thin
            films and nonlinear surface spin waves, magnetic frustrations in
            HTSC, complicated topological solitons in AFM with dislocations,
            dynamical and topological solitons and internal modes in quasi 2D
            essentially discrete FM, exotic magnetic solitons, magnetic
            structure and dynamics of FM/AFM perfect and imperfect interfaces
            (especially exchange bias phenomenon). Recently the main interests
            are concentrated on the structure and dynamics of magnetic vortices,
            vortex pairs and their interaction with spin waves and external
            fields, magnetic vortices in magnetic nanodots, magnetic solitons
            interaction with the point sources of external high frequency field.

            Special problems of nonlinear mechanic and mathematical aspects of
            solitonic theory were studied including: some asymptotic techniques
            for envelope solitons in ID- 2D- and finite size systems; Hirota
            transformation, N-solitons solutions and spin-wave spectrum in the
            presence of domain walls; exact solutions for incommensurated
            systems; the connection of solitons in the systems with distributed
            parameters with their quasi-soliton analogous in the systems with
            finite number degrees of freedom. Recently some problems of
            nonlinear optical pulse propagation in fibers were intensively
            studied. Another "optical activity" is connected with propagation of
            nonlinear optical beams through spatial periodic media and
            properties of optical "supersolitons”. The particular attention is
            devoted to investigation of "gap-solitons" and their discrete
            analogs.
