<p align="justify"><b>Current research activities: Many-electron phenomena in
non-Fermi conductors.</b></p>
<p align="justify">Nowadays non-Fermi conductors wherein an interaction between
the electrons is strong, and as a consequence of this the conventional
charged-Fermi-liquid theory fails, are in the focus of attention. Investigations
of these systems carried out during the last two decades revealed fundamentally
novel phenomena and structures, which provide magnificent opportunity to create
electronic devices with remarkable previously unknown features, including
quantum computing. In our theoretical investigations the primary emphasis is
placed upon low-dimensional lattice electron systems wherein the inter-electron
repulsion suppresses electron hopping and results in formation of a
self-localized “frozen” electron phase (FEP). We have studied various
important manifestations of this macroscopic state:</p>
<p align="justify">1) The ground state (GS) and superconducting properties of a
layered sd-electron system consisted of wide-band s-electron layers and
narrow-band d-electron ones being in the FEP state were investigated. This
system was found to possess superconductivity of pure Coulomb origin, the
superconducting transition temperature attaining values of the order of d-band
width. (A.A.Slutskin and L.Yu.Gorelik, Low Temp. Phys., 19(11), p.852, 1993)</p>
<p align="justify">2) The low-temperature thermodynamics of 1D FEP (generalized
Wigner crystal) was considered. It was studied how heating modifies inherent to
1D FEP a devil-stair case GS dependence of the electron density on the
chemical potential. (V.V.Slavin, A.A.Slutskin, Phys. Rev. B, 54(11), p. 8095
(1996)).</p>
<p align="justify">3) A novel macroscopic phenomenon, charge carrier stripe
formation and effective lowering of dimension, was found to be inherent in 2D
lattice systems with a long-range inter-particle repulsion. Basing on this fact,
a general analytical procedure has been formulated to describe fully the GS of
these systems. The conclusion was made that charge ordering into stripes
revealed in copper-oxide superconductors can be caused solely by long-range
Coulomb hole-hole repulsion. (A.A.Slutskin, V.V.Slavin, H.A.Kovtun, Phys. Rev.
B, 61(20), p.14184 (2000))</p>
<p align="justify">4) It was shown that under strong-Anderson-localization
conditions and at sufficiently low electron densities a Coulomb inter-electron
repulsion orders localized electrons into a slightly distorted crystal lattice
(for the system dimension &gt; 1). A phase transition between this state and the
conventional Coulomb glass was found to occur with increasing of the electron
density. (A.A.Slutskin, M. Pepper, H.A.Kovtun, Europhys. Lett., 62(5), p. 705
(2003))</p>
<p align="justify">5) The low-temperature thermodynamics of 2D FEP has been
recently studied, taking into account the above-mentioned effective lowering of
dimension. We succeeded in resolving this problem in terms of the so-called
exactly solvable full six-vertex model. A second-order phase transition between
2D generalized Wigner crystal and a liquid of strongly correlated electron
stripes with thermally produced fractures (kinks) was found to take place. The
phase equilibrium curve on the plane ‘temperature<font face="Courier New">–</font>chemical
potential’ has a sophisticated structure, abutting on the chemical-potential
axis at the endpoints of the devil-stair intervals. The charge carriers in the
liquid phase turn out to be kinks with a fractional charge. (A.A.Slutskin,
H.A.Kovtun, prep. for submission to Phys. Rev. B)</p>
<p align="justify">6) Recently it has been found that an arbitrarily weak random
distortion of a host lattice causes the formation of point defects
(frustrations) in the 1D generalized Wigner crystal and breaks down the
long-range electron-electron correlation in the GS. This results in a novel
“quasi-nonergodic” macroscopic behavior of the system. (A.A.Slutskin,
H.A.Kovtun, V.V.Slavin, prepared for submittion to Phys. Rev. Lett.).</p>
