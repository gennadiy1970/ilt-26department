          <h4>Many-electron phenomena in non-Fermi conductors.</h4>
          <p>
            Nowadays non-Fermi conductors wherein an interaction between the
            electrons is strong, and as a consequence of this the conventional
            charged-Fermi-liquid theory fails, are in the focus of attention.
            Investigations of these systems carried out during the last two
            decades revealed fundamentally novel phenomena and structures, which
            provide magnificent opportunity to create electronic devices with
            remarkable previously unknown features, including quantum computing.
            In our theoretical investigations the primary emphasis is placed
            upon low-dimensional lattice electron systems wherein the
            inter-electron repulsion suppresses electron hopping and results in
            formation of a self-localized “frozen” electron phase (FEP). We have
            studied various important manifestations of this macroscopic state:
          </p>
          <ol class="publications-list">
            <li>
              The ground state (GS) and superconducting properties of a layered
              sd-electron system consisted of wide-band s-electron layers and
              narrow-band d-electron ones being in the FEP state were
              investigated. This system was found to possess superconductivity
              of pure Coulomb origin, the superconducting transition temperature
              attaining values of the order of d-band width. (A.A.Slutskin and
              L.Yu.Gorelik, Low Temp. Phys., 19(11), p.852, 1993)
            </li>
            <li>
              The low-temperature thermodynamics of 1D FEP (generalized Wigner
              crystal) was considered. It was studied how heating modifies
              inherent to 1D FEP a devil-stair case GS dependence of the
              electron density on the chemical potential. (V.V.Slavin,
              A.A.Slutskin, Phys. Rev. B, 54(11), p. 8095 (1996)).
            </li>
            <li>
              A novel macroscopic phenomenon, charge carrier stripe formation
              and effective lowering of dimension, was found to be inherent in
              2D lattice systems with a long-range inter-particle repulsion.
              Basing on this fact, a general analytical procedure has been
              formulated to describe fully the GS of these systems. The
              conclusion was made that charge ordering into stripes revealed in
              copper-oxide superconductors can be caused solely by long-range
              Coulomb hole-hole repulsion. (A.A.Slutskin, V.V.Slavin,
              H.A.Kovtun, Phys. Rev. B, 61(20), p.14184 (2000))
            </li>
            <li>
              It was shown that under strong-Anderson-localization conditions
              and at sufficiently low electron densities a Coulomb
              inter-electron repulsion orders localized electrons into a
              slightly distorted crystal lattice (for the system dimension > 1).
              A phase transition between this state and the conventional Coulomb
              glass was found to occur with increasing of the electron density.
              (A.A.Slutskin, M. Pepper, H.A.Kovtun, Europhys. Lett., 62(5), p.
              705 (2003))
            </li>
            <li>
              The low-temperature thermodynamics of 2D FEP has been recently
              studied, taking into account the above-mentioned effective
              lowering of dimension. We succeeded in resolving this problem in
              terms of the so-called exactly solvable full six-vertex model. A
              second-order phase transition between 2D generalized Wigner
              crystal and a liquid of strongly correlated electron stripes with
              thermally produced fractures (kinks) was found to take place. The
              phase equilibrium curve on the plane ‘temperature–chemical
              potential’ has a sophisticated structure, abutting on the
              chemical-potential axis at the endpoints of the devil-stair
              intervals. The charge carriers in the liquid phase turn out to be
              kinks with a fractional charge. (A.A.Slutskin, H.A.Kovtun, prep.
              for submission to Phys. Rev. B)
            </li>
            <li>
              Recently it has been found that an arbitrarily weak random
              distortion of a host lattice causes the formation of point defects
              (frustrations) in the 1D generalized Wigner crystal and breaks
              down the long-range electron-electron correlation in the GS. This
              results in a novel “quasi-nonergodic” macroscopic behavior of the
              system. (A.A.Slutskin, H.A.Kovtun, V.V.Slavin, prepared for
              submittion to Phys. Rev. Lett.).
