<p>Graduated from Kharkov State University (Physical Department) in 1956.<br>
PhD Phys &amp; Math, ILTPE, 1962,<br>
DSc Phys &amp; Math, ILTPE, 1988.</p>
<p><b>Affiliation: </b>Institute for Single Crystals (Kharkov), junior
researcher (1956 - 1961). ILTPE, junior researcher (1961-1963), senior
researcher (1963-1991), leading researcher (since 1991). The author and
co-author of about 150 scientific papers and two monographs in various fields of
the physics of dielectrics.</p>
<p><b>The main research area:</b> Dynamics and Relaxation of Electronic

Excitations in Wide-Band Dielectric Crystals</p>
<p><b>Main directions and results consist in what follows.</b></p>
<i>
<p>1. Essential role of two-site polarons with intrinsic vibrational degree
of freedom in relaxation processes.</p>
</i>
<p>Traditionally, a single relaxation path of holes and excitons along the band
dispersion branch was taken into account. It has been shown that in fact the
relaxation process is drastically affected by another relaxation path through
vibrational levels of two-site polarons covering the total energy range of
the corresponding band. Two relaxation channels act simultaneously with a
partial exchange of excitations. A possibility was found to populate each 
channel separately. The efficiency of energy transport is strongly dependent on 
the entry chosen. The developed notion explained a series of spectroscopically 
observed anomalies, in particular, a sharp anomaly in energy transport.</p>
<i>
<p>2. Coherent directional motion of two-site polarons with a large binding
energy.</p>
</i>
<p>It has been shown that vibrational degrees of freedom make hopping barrier
small compared to binding energy and lead to a possibility of a coherent
manner of motion at a low temperature. This explains an anomalous rate of
polaronic transport, observed in alkali halides at low temperatures, and its
sharp <i> decrease </i> with an <i> increase</i> of temperature. The existing notion on a hopping
motion, accelerated by an increase of temperature, is restricted to
polarons devoid of intrinsic structure.</p>
<p><i>3. Dynamics of two-site oxygen holes in garnets. </i></p>
<p>The mechanism of recombination and reorientation of two-site oxygen holes, 
strongly influenced by random intrinsic electric fields of photoproduced
charges, was derived from experimental data on photoinduced absorption and dichroism.</p>
<p><i>4. Structure and optical properties of excitons in small dielectric crystals 
in the vicinity of allowed transition.</i></p>
<p>A deep size rearrangement of excitonic states, not reducible to size quantization,
was established. This new notion explains anomalous polaritonic phenomena observed
experimantally in rare-gas solids consisting of small crystalline grains. </p>
