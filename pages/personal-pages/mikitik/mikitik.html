            <p>
              In particular, the H-T phase diagrams of type-II superconductors
              were analyzed, taking into account thermal fluctuations of the
              order parameter and flux-line pinning [13,17,36,38,46,53,97]. The
              complete set of the critical state equations for thin flat
              anisotropic superconductors was derived [31,59,71], and a number
              of critical state problems were solved (see Reviews [88,94]),
              including the problem of the vortex-shaking effect [37,41,49,72].
              Effects of a sample shape and of anisotropy of the flux-line
              pinning on magnetic relaxation in type-II superconductors were
              studied [20,24,30,39,47,56]. Vortex penetration into thin
              superconducting samples was analyzed, taking into account an
              interplay between the Bean-Livingston and the geometrical barriers
              for vortices in the superconductors [95].

              The main problems that have been studied: the semiclassical

              with degenerate electron energy bands [23,26]; the g factors of
              electron orbits [40,45,57]; the magnetization of electrons in
              crystals with degenerate or nearly degenerate bands
              [11,18,28,48,58,75], including topological semimetals
              [102,105,106]; the Berry phase in metals [26,58,74], in graphene
              [65,76,78], and in topological insulators [93]; electron
              topological transitions of 3.5 kind in crystals [98,100,101,103];
              spontaneous symmetry breaking of magnetostriction in metals [99]
              (i.e., a counterpart of the Jahn-Teller effect for crystalline
              solids with unlocalized electrons).

              Brief description of the research area and the obtained results:
              Degeneracy of the electron energy bands frequently occurs in
              crystals (and the topological semimetals are among them). In the
              crystals with inversion symmetry and weak spin-orbit interaction
              such degeneracy mainly takes place along the band-contact lines in
              the Brillouin zone. It was shown that if the electron orbit links
              with a band-contact line, an additional term appears in the
              well-known Onzager-Lifshits-Kosevich quantization rule. This term
              is a manifestation of the Berry phase. The modification of the
              quantization rule can be experimentally discovered as a change in
              the phase of the de Haas - van Alphen and Shubnikov - de Haas
              oscillations. This change enables one to detect the band-contact
              lines in crystals. If the spin-orbit interaction is taken into
              account, the Berry phase manifests itself as a large g factor of
              electron orbits even for a weak spin-orbit coupling. The
              band-contact lines cause the emergence of the electron topological
              transitions of 3.5 kind in metals. The types of the
              electron-energy-band degeneracy in crystals were found which lead
              to the so-called giant anomalies of the magnetic susceptibility in
              weak magnetic fields. These types cover the degeneracies occuring
              in the topological semimetals. For all these types, the electron
              magnetization was calculated both at weak and strong magnetic
              fields.
