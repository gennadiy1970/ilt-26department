              Novel phenomena in physics, such as Majorana fermions in condensed
              matter, were studied. It was shown that the presence of unbiased
              electrode restores zero-bias anomaly even for strong Majorana
              energy splitting. It was also shown that strong asymmetry provides
              one with the criteria to distinguish Majorana state from ordinary
              (impurity) resonance state.

              In contrast to most known actuation mechanisms in similar systems,

              A theory of kinetic phenomena in two-dimensional degenerated
              electron gas in heterostructures has been built. It has been shown
              that dynamics electron-electron scattering in such systems acts in
              a completely different way as compared to the three-dimensional
              metals. New kinetic effects were predicted, viz. (i)
              one-dimensional diffusion of charge carriers as a mechanism of
              charge transport in two-dimensional systems; (ii) the
              ultra-sensitivity to weak magnetic field of relaxation mechanisms,
              related to the two-dimensional electron-electron scattering at low
              temperatures, was predicted. Recently, both these effects and the
              typical hydrodynamic minimum of the electric resistance of
              two-dimensional high-mobility GaAs/AlGaAS channels have been
              observed experimentally by the group of Prof. L.W.Molenkamp

              A "spin-guide" source was proposed. This device makes possible a
              long-distance transmission of currents with a high degree of spin
              polarization. Under certain conditions a spin-guide could generate
              an almost ideally spin-polarized current, even when the magnetic
              material used is not fully polarized. The detailed theory of the
              spin-guide structures was developed and a number of schemes of
              spin field-effect transistor both with electrical and magnetic
              control were proposed and investigated theoretically. The role of
              electron-electron collisions in the charge and momentum transport

              observation of the negative thermal expansion of the textured
              carbon nanotubes observed at low temperatures was given. It is
              shown that this effect is caused by the rapid growth of the
              torsional oscillation amplitudes of individual nanotubes in the
              bundle with increasing temperature. A theory was developed that
